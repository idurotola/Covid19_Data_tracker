The COVID-19 Data Tracker project is designed to provide a comprehensive and real-time visualization of the pandemic's progression
Leveraging a continuous stream of data from various sources, the system aims to offer an up-to-date and detailed analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

The core functionality includes the ingestion of live data, processing it to ensure accuracy and relevance, and then displaying this information through an intuitive and interactive interface. 

This interface highlights key metrics such as infection rates, recovery rates, and mortality rates across different regions and demographics. The platform also incorporates advanced statistical models to predict future trends, offering valuable insights for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public.
